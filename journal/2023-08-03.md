This morning started with looking at how to compare time series. We want to measure how similar two time series are and ideally get some sort of confidence that they are the same / similar. 
Methods that could be of interest are Dynamic Time Windowing, granger causality, and cross correlation. The simplest approach looks to be using a standard distance metric such as mean absolute error. 
Unknown at this point is how to go from the comparison to some sort of statistical test for similarity.

My mind drifted onto note keeping and how to use tools to aid in research proceses like the time series research mentioned above. I'm now trialling foam to do this.
