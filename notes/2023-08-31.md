Yesterday was a struggle! Finding it difficult to push through when multiple obstacles occur in succession. The most frustrating problem was that the [[langchain]] and [[huggingface]] tools aren't loading on the data science machine and useful error messages are showing. Today I'm going to try using the tool on the local linux vm. 

**I achieved the one thing!!!**

**Achieve one thing**: On linux vm get basic vector db running and ingesting documents:
- run chroma db
- ingest multiple docs to [[chroma db]]
- print list of docs ingested
  - load and use [[huggingface]] [[embedding]] in [[langchain]]
