### Webscraper problems

RAND documents are unopenable when downloaded through the webscraper but ok to use when downloaded via the browser and uploaded in the uploader.
Key output for this issue indicates that it is the website blocking the download:

```

```

--> This was fixed by editing the header sent in the get request
