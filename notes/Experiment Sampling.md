# Experiment Sampling

Clarifying questions:
- Are we looking for the optimal configuration or are looking for the "edge" between failure and success?
- I think the first port of call is to run each of the ideas in the default configuration. 
- Let's lay out which of the variables have an expecetd direction of impact on the success measure. 
- What is the measure for success? Combat effectiveness?
- Do we have a map/plan of the variables that make up the variable space?
- What do we care most about? Sampling the space or finding a set of variables that leads to succes?

- Ed gives list of experiments to run. 
- Do random sample first
