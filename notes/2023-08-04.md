Today I want to look further into using a [[Permutation Test]] for two time series. It seems like series being [[Stationary]] is important before applying tests. I'm not sure of the sequence of methods that are to be used to test for stationarity or how to make a series stationary. 

[[Split keyboards]] for RSI look interesting!
