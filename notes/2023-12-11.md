We need to integrate the various parts of the forge components together. The knowledge extractor to solution experimentation link looks well defined but the hive tasker to hadean orchestrator does not currenlty feel that well defined.  

One issue with the orchestrator is that it's not clear what is needed to run on the rop for hadean. They are now saying that they need to run the orchestrator on a different machine from the vrf instance.
