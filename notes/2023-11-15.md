Testing [[internet connection]] between two linux machines. One as server the other as client. Use `iperf -s` on server and `iperf -c [server-ip]` on client. The data science machine ip to use here is `10.99.200.105`. You can find the ip address by doing `hostname -I`

[[Experiment Sampling]] I have a few questions to clear up!

[[huggingface]] Having to remove the snapshot download script from the dockerfile as a way of pre-downloading models. Need to look into how we can get that working again. Is it just due to the slow internet? 

#plans [[2023-11-16]]: 
- Re-run docker build for doc query container to download models
- Test text relevance endpoint in current state
- Finish text relevance build
- Incorportate text relevance into semantic recommender, give user button to get relevance of document. 
- Train sentence classifiers using the additional forge uk docs data
